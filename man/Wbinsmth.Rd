\title{Estimate the option probability and surprisal curves.}
\description{The surprisal curves for each item are fit to the surprisal 
transforms of choice probabilities for each of a set of bins of current
performance values \code{theta}.  The error sums of squares are minimized
by the surprisal optimization \code{smooth.surp} in the \code{fda}
package.  The output is a list vector of length \code{n} containing the
functional data objects defining the curves.}

  }
  \item{WfdList}{
    A numbered list object produced by a TestGardener analysis of a test.  Its length
    is equal to the number of items in the test or questions in the scale.  
    Each member of \code{WfdList} is a named list containing information computed during the analysis.
    These named lists contain these objects:
    \describe{
      \item{Wfd:}{A functional data object containing the \code{M} surprisal curves
        for a question.}
      \item{M:}{The number of options.}

      \item{D2Wmatfine:}{A matrix of the values of the second derivative of 
        surprisal curves over fine mesh.}
    }
    By default \code{Wbinsmth}  uses the \code{WfdList} member of \code{dataList}, 
    which is generated by the initialization with \code{Wbinsmth.init} within
    \code{make.dataList}.  Usually this is what is required.  
    However, \code{WfdList} may occasionally
    need to be entered from another source, and so included here as a separate 
    argument.
  }
  \item{thetaQnt}{A vector of length 2*n+1 containing the sequence of bin boundary and 
    bin centre values.}
  \item{wtvec}{A vector of length \code{n} of weights on observations.  Defaults to
    all ones.}
  \item{iterlim}{The maximum number of iterations used in optimizing surprisal
    curves.  Defaults to 20.}
  \item{conv}{Convergence tolerance.  Defaults to 0.0001.}
  \item{dbglev}{Level of output within \code{Wbinsmth}.  If 0, no output,
    if 1 the error sum of squares and slope on each iterations, and if 2
    or higher, results for each line search iteration with function \code{lnsrch}.}

\details{
  The function first bins the data in order to achieve rapid estimation of the 
  option surprisal curves. The argument \code{thetaQnt} contains the sequence 
  of bin boundaries separated by the bin centers, so that it is of length 
  \code{2*nbin + 1} where \code{nbin}
  is the number of bins.  
  These bin values are distributed over the percentile interval
  [0,100] so that the lowest boundary is 0 and highest 100.  
  Prior to the call to \code{Wbinsmth} these boundaries are computed so that 
  the numbers of values of \code{theta} falling in the bins are roughly equal.  
  It is important that the number of bins be chosen so that the bins contain 
  at least about 25 values.  
  
  After the values of \code{theta} are binned, the proportions that the bins 
  are chosen for each question and each option are computed.  Proportions of 
  zero are given NA values.
  
  The positive proportions are then converted to surprisal values where 
  surprisal = -log_M (proportion) where log_M is the logarithm with base M, 
  the number of options associated with a question.  
  Bins with zero proportions are assigned a surprisal that is appropriately 
  large in the sense of being in the range of the larger surprisal values 
  associated with small but positive proportions. This surprisal value
  is usually about 4.
  
  The next step is to fit the surprisal values for each question by a 
  functional data object that is smooth, passes as closely as possible to an
  option's surprisal values, and has values consistent with being a surprisal 
  value.  The function \code{smooth.surp()} is used for this purpose.  The
  arc length of thme item information curve is also computed.
  
  Finally the curves and other results for each question are saved in object
  \code{WfdList}, a list vector of length n, and the list vector is returned.
