\title{
  Image of the Test Tnformation Curve in 2 or 3 Dimensions
}
\description{
  The test information curve is the trajectory of joint variation of all 
  the surprisal curves within the ambient space of dimension the total number 
  of curves.  But usually a very high percent of the shape variation in the 
  curve can be represented in either two or three dimensions using the singular
  value decomposition of a matrix of total curve values over a fine mesh.  
  The resulting approximation is converted to a set of surprisal curve values.

\usage{
  TestInfo_svd(scrfine, SfdList, itemindex=1:n, nharm=2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{scrfine}{A fine mesh of values over which the image is plotted.  This 
  is usually either the score index theta or the test arc length.}
  \item{SfdList}{A list vector of length n, the number of test items.  
  Each list in the vector contains values of the surprisal curves for that
  item.}
  \item{itemindex}{A vector of item indices to be used in the approximation.}
  \item{nharm}{The number of dimension in the approximation, usually either 
  two or three.}
}
\value{
  The approximation is returned as a surprisal functional data object, and so
  are the percentages of the total variation fit by each dimension in the
  approximation.
