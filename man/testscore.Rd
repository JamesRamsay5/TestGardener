\title{Compute the expected test score by substituting probability of choices
for indicator variable 0-1 values.
Binary items assumed coded as two choice items.}
\usage{
  testscore(theta, WfdList, optList)
}
\arguments{
  \item{theta}{Initial values for score indices in the interval [0,100]. 
    A vector of size \code{N}.}
  \item{WfdList}{
    A numbered list object produced by a TestGardener analysis of a test.  Its length
    is equal to the number of items in the test or questions in the scale.  
    Each member of \code{WfdList} is a named list containing information computed 
    during the analysis.
    These named list in each member contains these objects:
    \describe{
      \item{Wfd:}{A functional data object containing the \code{M} surprisal curves
        for a question.}
      \item{M:}{The number of options.}
      \item{Pbin:}{A matrix containing proportions at each bin.}
      \item{Wbin:}{A matrix containing surprisal values at each bin.}
      \item{Pmatfine:}{A matrix of probabilities over a fine mesh.}
      \item{Wmatfine:}{A matrix of surprisal values over a fine mesh.}
      \item{DWmatfine:}{A matrix of the values of the first derivative of 
        surprisal curves over fine mesh.}
      \item{D2Wmatfine:}{A matrix of the values of the second derivative of 
        surprisal curves over fine mesh.}
    }
  }
  \item{optList}{A numbered list of length n.  Each member contains the weights
    assigned to each option for that item or question.}
}
