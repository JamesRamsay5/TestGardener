\title{
Functional principal components analysis of information curve
}
\description{
  A test or scale analysis produces a space curve that varies with in the space of 
  possible option curves of dimension \code{Sdim}.  Fortunately, it is usual that most
  of the shape variation in the curve is within only two or three dimensions, and these
  can be fixed by using functional principal components analysis.
}
\usage{
  Spca(SfdList, Sdim=NULL, nharm=2, rotate=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{SfdList}{A numbered list object produced by a TestGardener analysis 
  of a test.  Its length is equal to the number of items in the test or 
  questions in the scale.  Each member of \code{SfdList} is a named list 
  containing information computed during the analysis.}
  \item{Sdim}{Interval over which curve is plotted. All if Sdim == NULL.}
  \item{nharm}{The number of principal components of the test information or scale 
  curve to be used to display the curve.  Must be either 2 or 3.}
  \item{rotate}{If true, rotate principal components of the test information or 
  scale curve to be used to display the curve to VARIMAX orientation.}
}
\value{
A named list with these members:
  \item{harmvarmxfd}{Functional data objects for the principal
    components of the curve shape.} 
  \item{varpropvarmx}{Proportions of variance accounted for by the principal 
    components}
}
